 So What's RawScripts? (i.e. 'intro')

Rawscripts is browser based screenwriting software. You open up your
web browser and you can write, edit, manage and collaborate on your
screenplays. It's the software currently running at
www.rawscripts.com, if you want to see what it's got.

Who Made Rawscripts?
====================

Hey, I'm Ritchie. I make short `videos
<http://ritchiewilson.com/videos.html>`_ time to time, and write and
go to school. Also, I made this screenwriting software with no real
background in programming. That means I'm really proud of what I made,
but it also forewarns you about what's inside.

What It Was
===========

This was the plaything of someone who wanted to learn how the internet
works.

Rawscripts was also a tool I started making for myself because other
screenwriting software wasn't cutting it. Then, as the software got
better, it was a tool for me and family and some friends. I worked
alone, for fun, and more people signed up, and now I'm hosting a
couple thousand screenplays.

Also, Rawscripts was, until recently, proprietary software.

What It Has Become
==================

Rawscripts has become both :ref:`full featured software
<full-featured-software>` and an :ref:`ugly bag of code vomit
<code-vomit>`, all :ref:`licensed under the AGPLv3 <floss>`. Enjoy.

.. _full-featured-software:

Full Featured Software
----------------------

It's has a lot of great, working parts, all accesible from a browser without downloading new software. Heck, I use it
because:

* A clean, browser based screenplay editor
* Shows exact format and pagination 
* Export to PDF. 
* Export to formatted txt so you can open scripts in other software.  
* Collaborative notes
* Complete revision history
* Title page editor
* And lots more

.. _code-vomit:

An Ugly Bag of Code Vomit
-------------------------

Rawscripts was a way to learn some programming skills and it
shows. What time I put into Rawscripts now is often just cleaning up
poor decisions I've made. Here are some things I've been dealing with:

* Messy, inefficient code. But it works!
* Some parts were written recently. Some of the code written when I
  was a total newbie.
* Poor documentation
* Built on AppEngine. A good, nerf way to get going, but it's time to
  end that relationship and get the code working on any LAMP-ish
  stack.
* Tests? Damn, that'd be nice.

.. _floss:

FLOSS
-----

I've spent a year learning programming through web tutorials, message
boards, and studying freely distributed code. And you've got to
me. You've won me over Mr. Stallman. AGPLv3 moving forward.

But more than just Open Source, this ought to be a :ref:`community <community>` creating
the tools we use. Come by and say hi!

What It Will Be
===============

I like this thing, but theres big room for improvement. Rawscripts
should be:

* Easily installed and hosted anywhere (Not just AppEngine)

* Scalable from one user on a plug server to a video production studio
  with hundreds of collaborators

* Should somehow federate with other installations.

* Should be extensible to fit peoples different production needs.

* World domination or whatever

* Committed to using and supporting open standards and platforms

So, that's pretty straight forward.
