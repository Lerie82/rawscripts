<h3>ENSEMBLE</h3>
<h6>(singing)</h6>
<h4>Hail, hail Freedonia! Land of the Brave and Free!</h4>
<h2>The President, Groucho, is hidden in the back. He sidles up to a guard and tugs at his sleeve.</h2>
<h3>GROUCHO</h3>
<h4>You expecting someone?</h4>
<h3>GUARD</h3>
<h4>Yes.</h4>
<h2>The Ensemble strikes up again. Groucho raises his cigar in salute.</h2>
<h3>ENSEMBLE</h3>
<h4>Hail, hail Freedonia! Land of the Brave and Free!</h4>
<h3>MRS. TEASDALE</h3>
<h6>(spots Groucho)</h6>
<h4>Oh, your Excellency! We've been expecting you. As Chairwoman of the Reception Committee I extend the good wishes of every man woman and child of Freedonia--</h4>
<h3>GROUCHO</h3>
<h6>(pulling out a deck of cards)</h6>
<h4>Never mind that stuff. Pick a card.</h4>
<h3>MRS. TEASDALE</h3>
<h4>A card? What will do with a card?</h4>
<h3>GROUCHO</h3>
<h4>You can keep it, I've got fifty-one left. Now what were you saying?</h4>
<h3>MRS. TEASDALE</h3>
<h4>As Chairwoman of the Reception Committee I welcome you with open arms.</h4>
<h3>GROUCHO</h3>
<h4>Is that so? How late do you stay open?</h4>
<h3>MRS. TEASDALE</h3>
<h4>I've sponsored your appointment because I feel you are the most able statesman in all Freedonia.</h4>
<h3>GROUCHO</h3>
<h4>Well, that covers a lot of ground. Say, you cover a lot of ground yourself. You better beat it, I hear they're going to tear you down and put up an office building where you're standing. You can leave in a taxi. If you can't get a taxi you can leave in a huff. If that' too soon you can leave in a minute and a huff. You know you haven't stopped talking since I got here you must have been vaccinated with a phonograph needle.</h4>
<h3>MRS. TEASDALE</h3>
<h4>The future of Freedonia rests on you. Promise me you'll follow in the footsteps of my husband.</h4>
<h3>GROUCHO</h3>
<h6>(to camera)</h6>
<h4>How do you like that? I'm haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.</h4>
<h6>(to Teasdale)</h6>
<h4>Not that I care, but what happened to your husband.</h4>
<h3>MRS. TEASDALE</h3>
<h4>Why, he's dead.</h4><h3>GROUCHO</h3><h4>I bet he's just using that as an excuse.</h4><h1 id="2">Int.
