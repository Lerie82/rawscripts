There are MANY ways to contribute. Even if you don't write code, we need writers, producers, testers, bug reporters, complainers, visionaries, evangelists, graphic designers, UI designers, system administrators, and sages. But if you DO write code, that's awesome too. Either way, you should start by:

Joining the Community
=====================

Get in on the conversation, say "hey", see what people are up to.

* Check out the mailing list on google groups
* Come chat on IRC at #rawscripts on Freenode.net

Use the Software
================

You can also start by just using the software. Go to rawscripts.com, sign up and start writing. Poke around and tell us what you think.

Write Code
==========

The code is hosted at gitorious.org/rawscripts/rawscripts, so grab it, start a new branch and see what you can do.

Evangelize
==========

If you like what you see, get the word out there however you know how. Blog, post to messege boards, talk it up around the water cooler. And let us know what you're up to.

File Bugs
=========

There is an issue tracker set up at issues.rawscripts.org 

There you can tell everyone what's broken or missing or odd. Be sure to write up everything you know, like how to reproduce the problem, which browser you were using, did it used to work...? Anything and everything.

Run Your Own Instance
=====================

Have mercy, you want to run this code yourself?! Cool! Check out RUNNING YOUR OWN INSTANCE
