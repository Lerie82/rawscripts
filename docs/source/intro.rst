Who Made Rawscripts?
====================

Hey, I'm Ritchie. I make short films time to time, and write and go to
school. Also, I made this software with no real background in
programming. That means I'm really proud of what I made, but it also
forewarns you about what's inside.

What It Was
===========

This was a tool I started making for myself because other software
wasn't cutting it. Then, as the software got better, it was a tool for
me and family and some friends. I worked alone, for fun, and more
people signed up, and now I'm hosting a couple thousand screenplays.

Also, Rawscripts was, until recently, proprietary software.

What It Has Become
==================

It's become both full featured software and a bag of code vomit, all licensed under the AGPL. Enjoy.

Full Featured Software
----------------------

It's it a lot working great, working parts. Heck, I use it because:

* A clean, browser based screenplay editor
* Shows exact format and pagination 
* Export to PDF. 
* Export to formatted txt so you can open scripts in other software.  
* Collaborative notes
* Complete revision history
* Title page editor
* And lots more

An Ugly Bag of Code Vomit
-------------------------

This was a way to learn some programming skills and it shows. What
time I put into the project is now just cleaning up poor decisions
I've made. Here are some things I've been dealing with:

* Messy, inefficient code. But it works!
* Lacking documentation
* Built on AppEngine. A good, nerf way to get going, but it's time to
  end that relationship and get the code working on any LAMP-ish
  stack.
* Google-Closure library. Not terrible, but not the vibrant ecosystem
  that is jQuery
* Tests? That'd be nice

FLOSS
-----

I've spent a year learning programming through web tutorials, message
boards, and studying Open Source code. And you've got to me. You've
won me over Mr. Stallman. AGPL moving forward.

What it will be
===================

* Easily hosted anywhere 

* Scalable from one user on a plug server to a video production studio
  with hundreds of collaborators

* Should federate with other instances.

* Should be extensible to fit peoples different production needs.

* World domination or whatever

* Committed to using and supporting open standards and platforms

So, that's pretty straight forward.
