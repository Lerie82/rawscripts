There are MANY ways to contribute. Even if you don't write code, we
need writers, producers, testers, bug reporters, complainers,
visionaries, evangelists, graphic designers, UI designers, system
administrators, and sages. But if you DO write code, that's awesome
too. Either way, you should start by:

Joining the Community
=====================

The first thing to do is get in on the conversation, say "hey", see
what people are up to.

* Check out the mailing list on google groups
* Come chat on IRC at #rawscripts on Freenode.net

Step one complete? Awesome. Start getting involved in any number of ther ways. Like:

Use the Software
================

You can go use the software this minute at `rawscripts.com <http://www.rawscripts.com>`_.

We need writers using the software, and we need their feedback. It can
also be a good way to familiarize yourself with the project.

Write Code
==========

Download code and libraries, make a new branch in git and go for it.

Check out more complete :ref:`instructions <working-on-code>` for
getting started.

Evangelize
==========

If you like what you see, get the word out there however you know
how. Blog, post to messege boards, talk it up around the water
cooler. And let us know what you're up to.

File Bugs
=========

There is an issue tracker set up at `issues.rawscripts.org <http://issues.rawscripts.org>`_. 

There you can tell everyone what's broken or missing or odd. Be sure
to write up everything you know, like how to reproduce the problem,
which browser you were using, did it used to work...? Anything and
everything.

Run Your Own Instance
=====================

Have mercy, you want to run this code yourself?! 

Cool! Check out :ref:`instructions and warnings <deployment>`.
